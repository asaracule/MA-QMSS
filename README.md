<!-- ABOUT ME -->
## About Me

Hello there! Welcome to my personal GitHub repository!

Born and raised in Singapore, I enjoy traveling the world, immersing myself in different cultures, and meeting people of different backgrounds. Is it through conversations that I gain a richer perspective on the issues burgeoning our times, and I endeavor to carry this very attitude of open-mindedness and diversity into the workplace. I am a versatile and adaptable team player, strongly holding the belief that people always come first. Commitment, integrity, and empathy are values that I strongly resonate with, and I am eager to work with people and organizations that share similar views.

I am currently pursuing a Master of Arts in Quantitative Methods in the Social Sciences at Columbia University. I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science (First Class Honours) in Economics from University College London. My rich experience in economic policy analysis, backed by a strong foundation in econometrics and data science using  Python, R, and STATA puts me on a strong foot to contribute to public policy in Singapore. Having lived and studied in diverse countries spanning three continents, I am able to bring fresh perspectives and synthesize innovative solutions to solve problems in our ever-changing and dynamic world.

Shortly after my postgraduate studies, I will pursue a career with the Republic of Singapore Air Force as an Air Traffic Controller and defense policymaker. I am excited to apply my quantitative research skills to elevate and revolutionize air operations and defense administration. I am also passionate about social policy, international affairs, and public administration. I am open to opportunities that might allow me to tap into these interests and skills I possess to improve the lives of fellow Singaporeans  Outside of work, I enjoy sipping coffee and reading biographies. I also am an avid landscape and street photographer hoping to document the bits and pieces of my life with computer pixels.

<!-- CURRENT PROJECTS -->
## Current Projects

These are the following projects I am working on:

**1. QMSS Master's Thesis: *Sentiment Analysis of the Impact of the 2013 Little India Riots on Attitudes Towards Migrants Workers (MWs) and Racial Harmony in Singapore* **

The 2013 Little India Riot was arguably a watershed moment in Singapore’s history. Little India is a popular area for Indian Migrant Workers (MWs) to congregate during the weekends (Ong, 2019). The riots happened in protest of a bus driver who ran over and killed 33-year-old construction worker Mr. Sakthivel Kumaravelu in Little India on 8 December 2013. The riot subsequently evolved to become more violent, with policemen and police vehicles that rushed onto the scene attacked and damaged. 

My thesis will aim to utilize data from various social media platforms to answer the following research question: To what extent did the 2013 Little India Riots affect the attitude of Singaporeans towards MWs, immigration policy, and Racial Harmony? Overall, I believe that the Singaporean sentiment towards MWs post-riot has worsened and that this has also negatively impacted the perception of Singaporeans on Racial Harmony. Natural language processing techniques will be used to analyze social media data on reactions towards MW-related articles before and after 2013 to detect whether there is indeed a difference in attitudes toward the MWs.

**2. Python Package: CalorieNinjas API Wrapper**

This project is meant for use with the CalorieNinjas API. The link to the API can be found at: https://rapidapi.com/calorieninjas/api/calorieninjas/

This Python package contains a 4 function to allow users to interact with the API call from the CalorieNinjas API.

- First, search() allows the user to search for individual food items and returns a dataframe containing all the nutritional values of that food item.

- Second, compare() allows the user to compare multiple food items and their key nutritional values (sugar, total fat and fiber). A bar chart is generated to allow users to look at a glance, the difference in the key nutritional values of the food items they wish to comapare.

- Third, cal_counter() allows the user to input a list of food items they have consumed from the meal, and returns the total calories consumed from this particular meal.

- Last, classifier() takes the users age and meal as an input. The function will return to total amounts of (a) sugar, (b) sodium, and (c) cholesterol consumed from the meal. According to the user's input age, the function will then tell the user whether the meal is healthy or unhealthy based on the sugar, sodium and cholesterol levels recommended for their age group.

**3. Sentiment Analysis of Singapore Budget Speeches from 2010-2023**

For this project, I have collected the Budget speeches of Singapore’s Minister for Finance to the Parliament of Singapore from 2010 to 2023.

The Budget speech, hereon referred to as Budget, is an annual speech by the Finance Minister, and aims to set out the government’s spending allocation for the year, and the new financial measures that the government is meting out to help Singaporeans. From 2010 to 2023, the Budget was delivered by three Finance Ministers - Tharman Shammugaratnam from 2010 to 2015, Heng Swee Keat from 2016 to 2021, and Lawrence Wong from 2022 to 2023. All three Finance Ministers are from the ruling party, the People’s Action Party (PAP), and were also the sitting Deputy Prime Minister when their speeches were delivered. Tharman Shammugaratnam is considered a part of the 3G (3rd generation) leadership of the PAP, with Heng Swee Keat and Lawrence Wong part of the 4G.

Interestingly, the three Finance Ministers were three of the most popular politicians in Singapore. Shortly after the 2015 general elections, Heng Swee Keat was initially touted to succeed Lee Hsien Loong as the next Prime Minister, before health issues forced him to step aside for Lawrence Wong to be the (current) frontrunner in 2022.

Singapore had also experienced several significant events, including two general elections in 2015 and 2020, the celebration of its Golden Jubilee, and most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic. External global events of significance in this period include the US-North Korean tensions and the Ukraine- Russia war. My analysis aims to quantify how the Singapore budget has evolved over the years using natual language processing techniques, including how the priorities of the PAP government has changed, and the governing style of each of the three finance ministers.
